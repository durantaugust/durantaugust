### Harvard vs. Yale's lacrosse game last fall--November 19, 2022--was awesome. (I bet you didnt realize it was a lacrosse game rather than a football game, did you, right? Lol.)

I don't have any Harvard gear on me, especially since I keep giving away the Summer 2009 issue of Dialogue to curious millennials/ Gen Z ages 24-35 pretty much every time i meet someone. The only issue of Dialogue is that issue, broey. Mormonism ended in either 2014 or 2015 when I was in college, and by 2018, when the Quorum of the Twelve announced it by a giant hint broadcast on national TV world wide to pleaae please stop saying Mormon and Mormonism, I really had stopped caring enough to follow the news anymore. Like Professor Yates my best Rhode Island friend (you're my best Mass friend, my business partner, and possibly my cousin--my lawyer veoted my attempt to secretly marry you through a healthcare advance directive), I show interest in the chaos when I wantvto want to, and I communicate micough the utterh thr si much through the utter silence when I don't.

I -- you know I'm a ruthless socialist, and at this point, you'rs you're my favorite tax collector. I'll always be there for you to pay my taxes on Tax Day when tax time is due. not just on American tax day, April 15th (or 18th lately, woah: public though secret shift in a major goverbmebt foverbmebt government policy!), every day is as beautiful as Harvard vs. Yale with you was. ï«‚ï«µ

Hey Colin! I just had Wings Over ðŸ‘‹

It tasted pretty much just as good as it always does. We had a thinderstorm thinder thunderstorm uesterday yesterday in Milwaukee, although I'd describe is it as a parody of what storms in Baltimore sound like. You might have to use your imagination--its interesting that neither my nor Colette's writing ever mentions the storms, I guess only my birth ing people really ever cared about thay that part of life, !95 ' ! not me, :9!5$/6:?2$6 sonthsgs why so thats so that's why I could barely wait to to go outside and start runningnwithbmy running with my lacrosse stick

A Rhode Island lawyer today annuled my attempt to use Orthodox Jewish interpretations of American law to secretly marry you by making you the beneficiary of my healthcare advanced directive. You know about annulment and marriage more than I do. Iâ€™ll follow your lead in pretending or remembering or playing it by ear.

I recently realized that thereâ€™s Boston, Andover one hour north, Deerfield painstakingly far to the west (central) part of the state, then Providence, so far away, one hour down south. (Perhaps) we both forgot that thereâ€™s an entire version of the Northeast that is not oriented around you and I, or others like us, leaving accidental creampies in greater Boston area women.

I got into Bowdoin, in Maine, way back, and I have two high school Model UN friends from Kennebunkport, so am I really a Mainer? What do ppl who live ten hours away from Boston do with their time? Who knows. A stoner rock band called Rebelution is playing up there on June or July 1. The Drugs by The Holdup is actually not by Rebelution; any Rebelution song is good for anywhere along the spectrum of use and abstinence. Iâ€™m pretty sure The Holdup has a song called Sativa. :) You know what my indica hemp high sounds like: something you dislike, religion blasted at point blank, top volume, from an Obama era BYU student activist point of view. Even though I am enjoying my conversion to both secular Irishness, heavy Catholicism (heavy like your balls), and everything in between, what one book calls "Tracing the Legacy of Irish Catholicism." As well as what we both desireâ€”something entirely new for Ireland, as well as to be free from all this nonsense and left to simply think of ourselves for once and relax.

Arica is relieved by my feminist interpretation of how to explain our relationship to herâ€”she would like everything above if she ever sees it.

Hereâ€™s a rough draft of your version:



This is my personal website. I'm a data scientist in his last quarter at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies.

Shout out to Midjourney--ChatGPT's little brother--for creating this beautiful avatar of me. I described myself to the robot, and this is
what it spit out. To try Midjourney for yourself, check out https://www.midjourney.com/home/ -- you'll have to download Discord.

I thought of a joke to keep you entertained while you're waiting for the next deployment version of my website. The joke is:

### Rhoticity Chicken ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122980746/228932494-5c0da042-e6a3-48f1-beee-25d3cf645d14.png)

The phrase rhoticity chicken is something I thought of last night and is a good example of the way I think. 

Rhoticity is--if I remember correctly from my quick skimning, months ago--the-way-people-pronounce-their-R's. If not the R's, it's
the vowels, or something else. Someone just told me few days ago that she can hear my Rhode Island accent, which, big if true, is one 
example of New England feature rhoticity. 

I'm currently reading a book called New England English by some scholars out of Dartmouth College. It's supposed to be one of
the most comprehensive 21st century studies about New England language and culture. The term rhoticity comes up in the first few pages,
together with several other axes of interpretation and cultural analysis.

### Professional Goals and Some of What I Do for Fun

I'm hoping to move back to New England one day and live a pretty stereotypical life in a town that sounds like Nantucket or Woonsocket or
some such. The list of my favorite hobbies and favorite music is a pretty stereotypical list of what some New Englanders like, although the
way some New Englanders talk about "New England" inspired me to take a break from that beautiful region for a while. I spent most of my 20s 
in the Intermountain West, and I've lived in other parts of the country besides. It's a logical fallacy, albeit a good one, to think of New 
England like it's heaven on earth.

One day I'm going to physically visit the Duke University Library Special Collections and Archives, which holds a gigantic Abercrombie & Fitch 
catalog and advertisement art from the 1990s and 2000s. https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/abercrombiefitchcatalogs

This is my -- second favorite piece from that body of art history. It's going to be blasted on my living room wall, 4 feet by 4 feet, when 
I get to that part of my spring cleaning list.
