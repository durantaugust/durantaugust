### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

This is my personal website. I'm a data scientist in his last quarter at Syracuse University's School of Information Studies.

Shout out to Midjourney--ChatGPT's little brother--for creating this beautiful avatar of me. I described myself to the robot, and this is
what it spit out. To try Midjourney for yourself, check out https://www.midjourney.com/home/ -- you'll have to download Discord.

If you're bored and want to read some critical theory, check out this peer-reviewed article I published in 2020, a 
Lecture Notes on Computer Science essay predicting the ChatGPT trend: "Digital Humanities Scholarship: A Model for Reimagining Knowledge Work
in the 21st Century."

I thought of a joke to keep you entertained while you're waiting for the next deployment version of my website. The joke is:

### Rhoticity Chicken ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122980746/228932494-5c0da042-e6a3-48f1-beee-25d3cf645d14.png)

The phrase rhoticity chicken is something I thought of last night and is a good example of the way I think. 

Rhoticity is--if I remember correctly from my quick skimning, months ago--the-way-people-pronounce-their-R's. If not the R's, it's
the vowels, or something else. Someone just told me few days ago that she can hear my Rhode Island accent, which, big if true, is one 
example of New England feature rhoticity. 

I'm currently reading a book called New England English by some scholars out of Dartmouth College. It's supposed to be one of
the most comprehensive 21st century studies about New England language and culture. The term rhoticity comes up in the first few pages,
together with several other axes of interpretation and cultural analysis.

### Professional Goals and Some of What I Do for Fun

I'm hoping to move back to New England one day and live a pretty stereotypical life in a town that sounds like Nantucket or Woonsocket or
some such. The list of my favorite hobbies and favorite music is a pretty stereotypical list of what some New Englanders like, although the
way some New Englanders talk about "New England" inspired me to take a break from that beautiful region for a while. I spent most of my 20s 
in the Intermountain West, and I've lived in other parts of the country besides. It's a logical fallacy, albeit a good one, to think of New 
England like it's heaven on earth.

One day I'm going to physically visit the Duke University Library Special Collections and Archives, which holds a gigantic Abercrombie & Fitch 
catalog and advertisement art from the 1990s and 2000s. https://archives.lib.duke.edu/catalog/abercrombiefitchcatalogs

This is my -- second favorite piece from that body of art history. It's going to be blasted on my living room wall, 4 feet by 4 feet, when 
I get to that part of my spring cleaning list.
